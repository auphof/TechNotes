As we embark on the journey of building modern cloud applications, the significance of infrastructure as code (IaC) and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices cannot be understated. IaC enables developers to manage and provision their cloud resources using code, bringing the same rigor to infrastructure management as we have with software development. CI/CD, on the other hand, provides an automated approach for building, testing, and deploying applications to production in a reliable, repeatable manner. Combining these practices sets the foundation for DevOps culture, promoting rapid, consistent, and reliable delivery of applications.

In this context, we're going to explore how to leverage Pulumi with Python for IaC, along with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for CI/CD. Pulumi, an open-source infrastructure as code tool, lets you create, deploy, and manage infrastructure on any cloud using your favorite programming languages. Python, with its simple syntax and rich ecosystem, is one of the supported languages for Pulumi.

We'll take a closer look at how to define and manage GCP resources using Pulumi's Python SDK, how to integrate this setup into a CI/CD pipeline, and how this can streamline the application deployment process. You'll learn to automate the creation and management of your GCP resources like App Engine, Cloud Run, GKE, Cloud Functions, and many more, while ensuring consistency, repeatability, and efficiency in your deployments.

By the end of this guide, you'll have a strong foundation in managing infrastructure as code using Pulumi with Python, and integrating this setup with CI/CD on Google Cloud Platform. Let's get started.
